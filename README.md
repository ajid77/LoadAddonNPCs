Creating a Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) mod to automatically load all addon NPCs requires some understanding of GTA V modding, scripting, and possibly working with the Script Hook V and other modding tools. Below is a basic outline and code example for such a mod using C# and Script Hook V .NET. This example assumes you have already installed Script Hook V and Script Hook V .NET.
Requirements:

    Script Hook V: To hook into the game.
    Script Hook V .NET: To write scripts in C#.
    A proper GTA V modding environment.

Steps:

    Install Script Hook V and Script Hook V .NET.
    Create a new C# script.
    Write the code to load addon NPCs.
    Compile and place the script in the scripts folder.

Script Hook V and .NET Setup:

    Download and install Script Hook V from Dev-C.
    Download Script Hook V .NET from GTA5-Mods.
    Extract the Script Hook V .NET files (ScriptHookVDotNet.asi, ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll, ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll) to your GTA V directory.

C# Script Example:

    Create a new C# file (e.g., LoadAddonNPCs.cs) in your preferred C# editor.

Create an addon NPC list:

    Create a text file named addonNPCs.txt in the scripts folder.
    List all addon NPC model names, one per line.

Compiling the Script:

    Open Visual Studio or any C# compiler.
    Create a new Class Library project.
    Add references to ScriptHookVDotNet2.dll and ScriptHookVDotNet3.dll.
    Add the script code to the project.
    Compile the project to generate a .dll file.

Placing the Script:

    Place the compiled .dll file into the scripts folder in the GTA V directory.
    Ensure the addonNPCs.txt file is also in the scripts folder.

Running the Game:

    Launch GTA V.
    The script will automatically run and load the addon NPCs as specified.

This example is a starting point and can be expanded with more complex functionality, error handling, and customization as needed.
